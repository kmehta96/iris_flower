# IRIS Setosa
## Dataset:
The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). 
## Description:
Data visualized using PDF for each of the input features as well as representation of output with the change in two feature inputs. KNN, Support Vector, Decision Tree & Logistic Regression were studied. Logistic Regression provides best results while another non-linear and non-parametric model performs overfitting with the given dataset. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification, and clustering examples and to test algorithms.
